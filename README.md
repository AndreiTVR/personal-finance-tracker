# Personal Finance Tracker

This is a simple personal finance tracker application built with Python. It allows users to track their income and expenses, view transactions, and generate basic financial reports.


## Features

- View all transactions
- Generate a basic financial report
- SQLite database for data storage


## Modules

- This package contains a generic transaction implementation for Python.

[Transaction](https://pypi.org/project/transaction/)

**Note** - The **main_menu()** is executed when you run your script. The if **__name__ == "__main__":** check ensures that main_menu() is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.



A database is crucial for this project to store and manage transaction data efficiently, ensuring quick access, data integrity, and scalability as the project grows.
